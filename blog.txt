site.sh - publish your jekyll site as curl-able script
------------------------------------------------------
may 3, 2019
  
recently, i came across a github repo[1] from @rootbeersoup that 
showed off his command-line curl version of his website.  you
could even navigate the site by curl-ing other links.  i thought
that was pretty cool and was going to implement the same thing
on my site.  at some point before i got around to that, i was
using a TUI app and thought it would be even cooler if i wrote
one of those that navigated my site. even better, i could write
it in such a way that you could just run 
  
```
curl https://hgal.me/.sh | bash
```
