hi, i'm harry. i'm a self-taught programmer from st. louis, but
i currently live in new orleans. i first learned java when i
wanted to make mods for minecraft. from there i learned basic
web-dev using php/mysql (but that was short lived and i suck at
it). after high school i got a job working for a local startup
writing javascript for a web application. i spend most of my
time writing node.js apps, react apps, and designing static
websites.
 
i also love music, movies, and math, but don't have as much
interesting stuff to say about that.
